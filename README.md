# Cross-platform normalization enables machine learning model training on microarray and RNA-seq data simultaneously

## Summary

We performed a series of supervised and unsupervised machine learning 
evaluations, as well as differential expression analyses, to assess which 
normalization methods are best suited for combining data from microarray and 
RNA-seq platforms. 

We evaluated five normalization approaches for all methods: 

1. log-transformation (LOG) 
2. [non-paranormal transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0649) (NPN)
3. [quantile normalization](http://bmbolstad.com/misc/normalize/bolstad_norm_paper.pdf) (QN)
4. [Training Distribution Matching](https://peerj.com/articles/1621/) (TDM)
5. standardizing scores (z-scoring; Z).

A [version](https://github.com/greenelab/RNAseq_titration_results/tree/c44e06938f4dbc035cefa3aa0d07d89740f1bdd0) of this project is detailed in our pre-print
[Cross-Platform Normalization Enables Machine Learning Model Training On Microarray And RNA-Seq Data Simultaneously](https://doi.org/10.1101/118349).

## Analysis

### Machine Learning Pipeline

Here's a schematic overview of our machine learning experiments:

**Overview of supervised and unsupervised machine learning experiments.** 

1. 520 TCGA Breast Cancer samples run on both microarray and RNA-seq were split 
into a training (2/3) and holdout set (1/3).
2. RNA-seq’d samples were "titrated" into the training set, 10% at a time (0-100%) 
resulting in eleven training sets for each normalization method. 
3. _Machine learning applications._ Three supervised multi-class (BRCA PAM50 subtype) 
classifiers—LASSO, linear SVM, and Random Forest—were trained on each training set 
and tested on the microarray and RNA-seq holdout sets. The holdout sets were projected 
onto and back out of the training set space using two unsupervised techniques, Independent 
and Principal Components Analysis, to obtain reconstructed holdout sets. The 
classifiers used in step 4A above were used to predict on the reconstructed holdout 
sets.

# To run the machine learning pipeline, run in top directory:
sh run_machine_learning_experiments.sh

# To run one repeat of the subtype classifier pipeline, use:
Rscript run_experiments.R
```

### Differential Expression Pipeline

Here's a schematic overview of our main differential expression experiment:

**Overview of differential expression experiment.** 

1. All matched TCGA breast cancer samples (n = 520) were considered when building the platform-specific 
“silver standards.” These standards are the genes that were differentially 
expressed at a specified False Discovery Rate (FDR) using data sets comprised 
entirely of one platform and processed in a standard way: log2-transformed 
microarray data and “untransformed” RSEM count data (preprocessed using the 
`limma::voom` function). 
2. RNA-seq’d samples were ‘titrated’ into the data set, 
10% at a time (0-100%) resulting in eleven experimental sets for each n
ormalization method. 
3. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using 
the `limma` package. We compared the Her2 and LumA subtypes as well as Basal
v. all other samples. 
4. Lists of experimental DEGs were compared to standard gene 
sets using Jaccard similarity. 

```
# Note: This requires the data to be processed to include matched samples only, 
# and split into training and test sets (0-expression_data_overlap_and_split.R)

# To run the differential expression pipeline, run in top directory:
sh run_differential_expression_experiments.sh
```

## Requirements

This analysis was performed in R. It requires R & Bioconductor packages 
detailed in `check_installs.R` to be installed.

One github package (`TDM`) is required. To install, run:

    library(devtools)
    devtools::install_github("greenelab/TDM")

**This analysis is [in the process](https://github.com/greenelab/RNAseq_titration_results/issues/18) of being moved to a Docker image.**

## Funding

This work was supported the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [GBMF 4552] and 
the National Institutes of Health [T32-AR007442, U01-TR001263].
